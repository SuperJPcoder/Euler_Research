                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta) \), is a fundamental result in mathematics, linking exponential, trigonometric, and complex functions. While numerous proofs exist, this paper presents a new approach discovered through the study of integration techniques. The motivation behind the exploration and the structure of the paper are outlined in this section.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="main-proof">
                <h2>Main Proof</h2>
                <p>
                    Consider the integral
                    \[
                    I = \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}.
                    \]
                    By applying the known antiderivative, we have \( I = -\cos^{-1}(x) \).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, we can manipulate the integral \( I \) as follows:
                    \[
                    I = \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{-1 \cdot (x^2-1)}}.
                    \]
                    Since \( x \) lies between \(-1\) and \(1\) for the original formula to hold, \( x^2 \leq 1 \). Thus, \( x^2 - 1 \leq 0 \), which makes both the terms inside the square root negative. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as
                    \[
                    I = \int \frac{dx}{-\sqrt{-1} \sqrt{x^2 - 1}}.
                    \]
                    \[
                    I = -\frac{1}{i} \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2-1}}.
                    \]
                    \[ I = i \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2-1}} \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ignoring the constant factor \(i\), we find
                    \[
                    \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} = \log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|).
                    \]
                    Therefore, we have
                    \[
                    I = i \log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|).
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Equating the expressions for \( I \) obtained using the direct formula and the manipulation, we get
                    \[
                    -\cos^{-1}(x) = i \log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|).
                    \]
                    Multiplying both sides by \(-i\), we obtain
                    \[
                    i \cos^{-1}(x) = \log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|).
                    \]
                    Letting \(\cos^{-1}(x) = \theta\), we have \( x = \cos(\theta) \) and \(\sqrt{1-x^2} = \sin(\theta) \). Therefore, substituting \( x \) and \(\sqrt{1-x^2}\) with \(\cos(\theta)\) and \(\sin(\theta)\) respectively, we arrive at
                    \[
                    i \theta = \log(|\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)|).
                    \]
                    Exponentiating both sides, we finally obtain Euler's formula:
                    \[
                    e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta).
                    \]
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    If we instead consider the integral as
                    \[
                    I = \sin^{-1}(x),
                    \]
                    we proceed similarly:
                    \[
                    I = \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \sin^{-1}(x).
                    \]
                    Equating this with our previous result, we have
                    \[
                    \sin^{-1}(x) = i \log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|).
                    \]
                    Letting \(\sin^{-1}(x) = \theta\), we have \( x = \sin(\theta) \) and \(\sqrt{1-x^2} = \cos(\theta) \). Thus,
                    \[
                    i \theta = \log(|\sin(\theta) + i\cos(\theta)|).
                    \]
                    Exponentiating both sides, we obtain the modified form of Euler's formula:
                    \[
                    e^{-i\theta} = \sin(\theta) + i\cos(\theta).
                    \]
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The derivative of \( -\cos^{-1}(x) \) is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, consider the function
                    \[
                    f(x) = \log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|).
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The derivative of \( f(x) \) can be computed using the chain rule:
                    \[
                    f'(x) = \frac{1}{x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}).
                    \]
                    Calculating the derivative inside the parentheses,
                    \[
                    \frac{d}{dx}(x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}) = 1 + \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}.
                    \]
                    Therefore,
                    \[
                    f'(x) = \frac{1}{x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \left( 1 + \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}.
                    \]
                    We can write it also as -
                    \[
                    \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-1}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-1 \cdot (1-x^2)}}.
                    \]
                    Since \( x \) lies between \(-1\) and \(1\) for the original formula to hold (output real numbers), therefore \( x^2 \leq 1 \). Thus, \( 1 - x^2\geq 0 \). Therefore, we can rewrite it as
                    \[
                    \frac{1}{-\sqrt{-1} \sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
                    \]
                    \[
                    = -\frac{1}{i} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
                    \]
                    \[= i\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    So the derivative of \( -\cos^{-1}(x) \) is \( i \) times the derivative of \( \log(x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}) \). Integrating both sides gives:
                    \[
                    -\cos^{-1}(x) = i \log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|),
                    \]
                    Multiplying both sides by \(-i\), we obtain
                    \[
                    i \cos^{-1}(x) = \log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|).
                    \]
                    Letting \(\cos^{-1}(x) = \theta\), we have \( x = \cos(\theta) \) and \(\sqrt{1-x^2} = \sin(\theta) \). Therefore, substituting \( x \) and \(\sqrt{1-x^2}\) with \(\cos(\theta)\) and \(\sin(\theta)\) respectively, we arrive at
                    \[
                    i \theta = \log(|\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)|).
                    \]
                    Exponentiating both sides, we finally obtain Euler's formula:
                    \[
                    e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta).
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>
                    This completes the proof using derivatives.

                <p>
                    The significance of the new proof and its implications are discussed in this section. A comparison with existing proofs in the literature is provided, highlighting the novelty and potential advantages of the proposed approach. Limitations and areas for further research are also addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason why \( e^{i\theta} = \sin(\theta) + i\cos(\theta) \) appears is rooted in the periodic and rotational symmetry of trigonometric functions. By considering \( \sin^{-1}(x) \) instead of \( \cos^{-1}(x) \), we essentially rotate the perspective of the unit circle representation of Euler's formula. Since \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) are phase-shifted by \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), their roles in the formula change correspondingly, demonstrating the inherent symmetry in Euler's identity and trigonometric relationships.

                <h2>Geometric Interpretation</h2>
                <p>
                    To understand the geometric interpretation, we should be aware that there are two kinds of angles: linear and rotational. We refer to the work of Boyajian for a detailed study on this, which can be cited as <a href="#ref-boyajian">[Boyajian]</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fundamental identity for the hyperbolic cosine function is given by:
                    \[
                    \cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
                    \]
                    This represents a linear angle. However, when we substitute \(x\) with \(ix\) (where \(i\) is the imaginary unit), due to \(i\)'s property of rotating by 90 degrees, the angle transitions from a linear to a rotational angle. Thus, we have:
                    \[
                    \cosh(ix) = \cos(x) = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}
                    \]
                    If we plot this, we get the graph of the cosine function. Similarly, if we plot the original hyperbolic cosine function, we get the graph of \(\cosh\).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can use a single formula to plot both functions on a special type of graph:
                    \[
                    \cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
                    \]
                    In this graph, the \(X\)-axis represents real inputs, the \(Z\)-axis represents imaginary inputs, and the \(Y\)-axis represents real outputs (since in both cases we obtain real outputs).
                </p>

                    Similarly, we can plot their inverse functions. The graph of \(-\cos^{-1}(x)\) is well-known. The inverse of the hyperbolic cosine function is given by:
                    To find the inverse of the function \( f(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \), we need to express \( x \) in terms of \( y \) where \( y = f(x) \).
                    \[\begin{aligned}
                    y &= \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \\
                    2y &= e^x + e^{-x} \\
                    2ye^x &= e^{2x} + 1 \\
                    e^{2x} - 2ye^x + 1 &= 0
                    \end{aligned}\]
                    Let \( u = e^x \). The equation becomes:
                    \[
                    u^2 - 2yu + 1 = 0
                    \]
                    Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( u = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -2y \), and \( c = 1 \):
                    \[\begin{aligned}
                    u &= \frac{2y \pm \sqrt{(2y)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} \\
                    u &= \frac{2y \pm \sqrt{4y^2 - 4}}{2} \\
                    u &= \frac{2y \pm 2\sqrt{y^2 - 1}}{2} \\
                    u &= y \pm \sqrt{y^2 - 1}
                    \end{aligned}\]
                    Since \( u = e^x \) and \( e^x \) is always positive, we select the positive root:
                    \[
                    e^x = y + \sqrt{y^2 - 1}
                    \]
                    Take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \( x \):
                    \[
                    x = \ln(y + \sqrt{y^2 - 1})
                    \]
                    Therefore, the inverse function of \( f(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \) is:
                    \[
                    f^{-1}(y) = \ln(y + \sqrt{y^2 - 1})
                    \]
                    \[
                    \cosh^{-1}(x) = \log(x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1})
                    \]
                    We can plot this graph as well on the special 3D graph mentioned above.

                    The derivative of \(\cos^{-1}(x)\) and \(\log(x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1})\) are the same, except that one is multiplied by \(i\) due to the change of plane (from the real-real \(XY\)-plane to the real-imaginary \(ZY\)-plane). This is because essentially the base formula is the same, just that the angle transitions from linear to rotational (real to imaginary).

                <h2>Geometric Interpretation</h2>
                <p>Let's examine the geometric implications of the slopes derived from our proof:</p>

                <h3>Slope of \(\cos^{-1}(x)\)</h3>
                <p>
                    At any point on the curve \(\cos^{-1}(x)\), the slope represents the rate of change of the angle formed between the curve and the \( x \)-axis. Mathematically, the slope of \(\cos^{-1}(x)\) is given by \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{i}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\). Geometrically, this slope introduces an imaginary component, indicating a rotation in the complex plane. It suggests that the curve \(\cos^{-1}(x)\) has a complex relationship with the \( x \)-axis, where the imaginary component represents a rotation.
                </p>

                <h3>Slope of \(-\cos^{-1}(x)\)</h3>
                <p>
                    At any point on the curve \(-\cos^{-1}(x)\), the slope represents the rate of change of the angle formed between the curve and the \( x \)-axis. Mathematically, the slope of \(-\cos^{-1}(x)\) is given by \(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{i}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\). Geometrically, this slope introduces an imaginary component, indicating a rotation in the complex plane. It suggests that the curve \(-\cos^{-1}(x)\) has a complex relationship with the \( x \)-axis, where the imaginary component represents a rotation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When taking the inverse cosine function, the domain changes from \((-1,1)\) to \(\mathbb{R} \setminus (-1,1)\). Thus, for \(-\cos^{-1}(x)\) to be defined, \(x\) must have a value beyond \(-1\) and \(1\), implicating hyperbolic trigonometry. The cosine of a complex number \(x\), where \(x\) is imaginary, yields real values greater than \(1\), illustrating a connection to hyperbolic functions.
                </p>

                <h3>Slope of \(\log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|)\)</h3>
                <p>
                    Similarly, at any point on the curve \(\log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|)\), the slope indicates the rate of change of the curve with respect to the \( x \)-axis. The slope of \(\log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|)\) is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1}}\), which is purely real. Geometrically, this slope represents a change along the \( x \)-axis without any rotation in the complex plane.
                </p>

                <h3>Relationship between slopes</h3>
                <p>
                    Observing that the slope of \(\cos^{-1}(x)\) is equal to \( i \) times the slope of \(\log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|)\), i.e., \(\text{Slope}(\cos^{-1}(x)) = i \times \text{Slope}(\log(|x + \sqrt{x^2 - 1}|))\), we infer that multiplying the real slope by \( i \) introduces a rotation. Multiplying by \( i \) essentially means rotating the curve by \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians in the complex plane.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Geometric Interpretation</h3>
                <p>
                    Visualizing the graph, with the \( x \)-axis representing all real inputs, the \( y \)-axis representing real outputs, and the \( z \)-axis representing imaginary outputs, we can understand the behavior of the functions. The multiplication by \( i \) causes a rotation of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians, which means that the graph formed on the \( xy \)-plane (real inputs and outputs) is rotated by \( 90 \) degrees to form the graph on the \( xz \)-plane (real inputs and imaginary outputs). This rotation reflects the intricate relationship between exponential, trigonometric, and complex functions, as encapsulated by Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta) \).
